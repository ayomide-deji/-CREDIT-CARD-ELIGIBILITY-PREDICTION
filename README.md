Introduction:

Problem Statement:

The influx of credit card applications in the banking sector comes with a significant operational challenge. The manual assessment of credit card applications is not only prone to errors, but requires a lot of time. to streamline this process and enhance efficiency, it is important to integrate machine learning techniques in the banking sector in order to automate credit card approval process. 

Aims/Objectives:

1 Develop an automatic credit card approval system using machine learning algorithms

Methodology:

1 Load the dataset to Jupyter Notebook

2 Split the data into test data and train data

3 Data Preprocessing: Identify a blend of numerical and non-numerical features, diverse value ranges, and missing entries for accurate model predictions,

4 Exploratory data analysis to extract insights,

5 Feature Engineering,

6 Modelling and Hyperparameter Tuning

7 Model Evaluation
